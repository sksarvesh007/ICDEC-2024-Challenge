# ICDEC 2024 Challenge: Vehicle Detection in Various Weather Conditions(VDVWC)

A YOLO (You Only Look Once) based model trained on the limited personal dataset given here : [dataset_link](https://github.com/Sourajit-Maity/juvdv2-vdvwc.git)

### CLASSES :

The dataset was quite imbalanced  , The `car` class had much more images than the other classes . Here is a basic visualization which shows the class imbalance

This high imbalance might lead to model bias which might not work great with the unseen data
